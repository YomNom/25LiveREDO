# 25LiveREDO
This is a Svelte+Vite project that redesigns the user interface for the 25Live scheduling system (https://25live.collegenet.com/pro/uc#!/home/dash) for the University of Cincinnati. This system is used by multiple colleges/universities and other organizations to schedule one-day events, such as classes and student hosted events. (To know more -> https://knowledge25.knowledgeowl.com/help/about-25live) A more pinpoint description is that this system is made only to schedule events and request resources for events, such as a projector. You wouldn't visit this website to sign up for an event. 

## Issues with 25Live for the University of Cincinnati
The website does not ask for your log in upon visiting the site and gives a guest user access to all events and location information hosted by the organization, which shouldn't be accessible by a guest user. However, it is not accessible for a logged-in user. It's difficult to see whether this issue is with the system itself or the organization using it, because when visiting other Universities 25Live it shows completely different layouts. Looking at the 25live for the University of Lousville, all that information is displayed automatically. However, when visiting 25live for the Univeresity of Dayton, you are asked to log in before being given access to the reservation/scheduling system (https://shibidp.udayton.edu/idp/profile/SAML2/Redirect/SSO?execution=e1s1). Because of that, this project primarily redesigns the layout for a logged-in user.

The influx of information presented to the user
The search function is used for everything. 
 On each page, there's an influx of unnecessary information because it's been setup for students and staff. Although I mentioned classes, an room can only be reserved for one day.
